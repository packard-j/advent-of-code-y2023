# Advent of Code - 2023
Solving the Advent of Code challenges in Haskell.

## Getting Started

For Nix users, start the development shell:
```sh
$ nix develop
```

Then, try running the tests:
```sh
$ stack test
```

To try out the Day 1 solution, try this example:
```sh
$ echo "4dventofcod3" | stack run
> 43
```
